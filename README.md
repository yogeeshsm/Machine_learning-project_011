🌤️ Weather Prediction using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a real-world application of machine learning: weather prediction. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional weather prediction app and gain hands-on experience with data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

📌 Overview
Predicting weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, or rainfall is a complex task that involves analyzing historical data and building robust models. This project uses Python and popular ML libraries to create a predictive system capable of forecasting weather patterns based on past trends.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python – Core programming language

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch – For building and training ML models

You can choose between Scikit-learn (for classical ML), TensorFlow, or PyTorch (for deep learning-based approaches).

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
cd weather-prediction
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended), then install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare the Dataset
Ensure your weather dataset is placed in the data/ directory. You can use publicly available datasets (e.g., NOAA, Kaggle).

4. Run the Notebooks
Use Jupyter or VSCode to explore and run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.

5. Run the App
Once your model is trained and saved, run predictions using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app/predict.py
